# AireLogicTest
An interview test for Aire Logic

Hello! 

I hope you enjoy reviewing my Lyric API test. I used the MusixMatch API as it seemed to provide the best functionality out of the other APIs I've encountered.

Instructions for usage:
-----------------------

You should have Visual Studio installed (I used VS2019) along with the C# .NET framework to run this application as it is a CLI program as requested.

1) Open the project.
2) Click "Play".
3) The program will ask you to input the name of an artist, so input your preferred artist & press "enter".
Error handling has been made at appropriate sections within the application as data from the API occasionally is returned in an unusable format.
4) The application will process this data for the artist, by iterating through their albums, & tallying the quantity of lyrics per track.
5) Upon finishing the iteration process, the program will invite the user to compare this artist with another. You can do this as many times as you'd like.

I hope you enjoy browsing this test as much as I enjoyed implementing it.
